These tasks often require significant resources, expertise, and international support, which may be beyond the capabilities of ordinary people without proper training and backing.","It is not feasible for ordinary people to take control of territory previously controlled by ISIS, as they lack the necessary military expertise, resources, and governance skills to effectively establish stability.","Why can't private individuals collectively take on ISIS, capture their territories, and establish control?","Private individuals collectively cannot take on ISIS, capture their territories, and establish control due to several reasons.
