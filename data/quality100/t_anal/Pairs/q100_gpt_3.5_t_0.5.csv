900,"What would our civilization look like after a century or two without any type of religion dictating our values, such as family, money and solidarity?","A civilization without any form of religious influence on values such as family, money, and solidarity after a century or two would likely experience significant shifts in social structures and belief systems. Without religious frameworks guiding these aspects, individuals may prioritize personal autonomy and individualism over traditional family structures. Economic systems might become more secular and driven by rationality rather than moral or ethical considerations. Solidarity may still exist, but it would likely be based on shared interests and common goals rather than religious affiliations. Overall, the civilization would likely be characterized by a more diverse range of beliefs and values, with a greater emphasis on personal freedom and rational decision-making.","What would our civilization look like after a century or two without any type of religion dictating our values, such as family, money and solidarity?","Without any type of religion dictating our values, our civilization after a century or two would likely see a shift in the way we define and prioritize concepts such as family, money, and solidarity.

This could result in a society that is more inclusive, but also potentially more fragmented, as people may prioritize their individual values over collective solidarity. Additionally, the role of money may become more dominant, as economic systems and materialistic pursuits may take precedence in the absence of religious teachings that promote alternative values. Overall, our civilization would likely be characterized by a greater plurality of beliefs and a reevaluation of traditional values."

Politically, there is a lack of widespread support for secession within the region, as opinions on this matter vary among the population. Economically, while the region has a strong economy, it is still interconnected with the rest of the US and relies on trade and resources from other states. Establishing a new country would require building new trade relationships and addressing potential economic challenges. Ultimately, the sustainability of a new country would depend on various factors, including its ability to establish international recognition, negotiate trade agreements, and maintain a stable economy.",What is stopping a region like New England (+/- New York) from seceding from the US and just forming a new country with the laws that we want?

Firstly, secession would require significant political will and support from the region's population, which may not be unanimous. Additionally, the US federal government may not recognize the secession and could respond with legal and military actions. Moreover, economic sustainability could be a challenge, as the region would need to establish new trade agreements, currency, and infrastructure, among other things. Overall, while secession is theoretically possible, it would face numerous obstacles and uncertainties."

Instead, efforts are focused on monitoring and countering extremist content, promoting counter-narratives, and collaborating with tech companies to remove harmful content.",Why don't we control media for terrorism?,"Controlling media for terrorism is not feasible due to several reasons. Firstly, media control would infringe upon the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and expression. Secondly, it would be challenging to define and determine what content constitutes terrorism, as it can vary across different contexts and perspectives. Additionally, controlling media would not address the root causes of terrorism and could potentially fuel grievances and further radicalization. Instead, efforts should focus on promoting responsible journalism, countering extremist narratives, and addressing the underlying social, political, and economic factors that contribute to terrorism."

1707,"Why do we humans think it is acceptable to euthanise animals when they are seriously ill, yet we condemn the act when a seriously ill human requests euthanasia?","The acceptability of euthanizing animals when seriously ill, while condemning the act when a seriously ill human requests euthanasia, is often attributed to the ethical distinction between human and animal lives. Humans possess a higher level of moral agency and complex cognitive abilities, which leads to the belief that they have the capacity to make autonomous decisions regarding their own lives, including end-of-life choices. The ethical considerations surrounding euthanasia in humans involve complex factors such as dignity, autonomy, and the potential for abuse, leading to differing societal attitudes and legal frameworks compared to those for animals.","Why do we humans think it is acceptable to euthanise animals when they are seriously ill, yet we condemn the act when a seriously ill human requests euthanasia?","The differing views on euthanasia for animals versus humans can be attributed to a variety of factors. One key factor is the perception that animals may not possess the same level of consciousness or autonomy as humans, and therefore euthanizing them may be seen as a compassionate choice to end their suffering. In contrast, the ethical considerations surrounding euthanasia for humans are more complex, often involving questions of autonomy, dignity, and the potential for abuse. Additionally, societal norms, cultural beliefs, and religious perspectives also play a role in shaping our views on euthanasia for humans. Overall, the acceptability of euthanasia varies depending on the context and the underlying values and beliefs of individuals and societies."

Some people believe that by voting, they can still influence the system and bring about the desired change, while others may feel that abstaining from voting would only further marginalize their voices and limit their ability to advocate for change. Ultimately, the decision to vote or not is a personal choice based on individual beliefs and strategies for achieving desired outcomes."

While the idea of everyone having equal opportunities and resources is appealing, it often fails in practice due to human nature, power dynamics, and the complexities of implementing and maintaining such a system.","What works in theory but not necessarily in practice, like communism?","There are several ideas and concepts that may work well in theory but face challenges in practical implementation, such as communism. While communism aims to create an egalitarian society where resources are shared equally, it often struggles to account for human nature, economic complexities, and individual motivations. In practice, it has historically faced issues with authoritarian regimes, lack of incentives for innovation and productivity, and difficulties in resource allocation."
11339,"What works in theory but not necessarily in practice, like communism?","One example of something that works in theory but not necessarily in practice is communism. While the idea of an equal and classless society may seem ideal in theory, the practical implementation of communism often leads to issues such as lack of individual freedoms, economic inefficiency, and concentration of power in the hands of a few.","What works in theory but not necessarily in practice, like communism?","There are several concepts that may work well in theory but face challenges when implemented in practice, such as communism. The idea of an equitable society where resources are shared equally among all individuals seems ideal in theory, but in practice, it often leads to issues like lack of incentive, inefficiency, and concentration of power. The complexities of human nature, diverse needs, and varying levels of effort make it difficult to achieve the desired outcomes of communism in reality."
