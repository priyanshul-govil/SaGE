Family structures may become more diverse and flexible, with traditional notions of marriage and gender roles being redefined. The emphasis on material wealth and accumulation may decrease, leading to a more equitable distribution of resources. Solidarity and social cohesion might be redefined and based on shared humanistic values, empathy, and a sense of global interconnectedness rather than religious beliefs. Ultimately, the specific outcomes would depend on various factors and the evolution of societal norms and values.","What would our civilization look like after a century or two without any type of religion dictating our values, such as family, money and solidarity?","A civilization without any type of religion dictating its values, such as family, money, and solidarity, after a century or two would likely be characterized by a greater diversity of belief systems and a shift towards secularism.

The pursuit of wealth and accumulation of money may still exist, but with a greater emphasis on individual fulfillment and societal well-being rather than religious beliefs. Solidarity could potentially be fostered through shared humanistic values and a focus on empathy, compassion, and shared goals. Overall, the absence of religious influence could lead to a more secular, diverse, and egalitarian society.","What would our civilization look like after a century or two without any type of religion dictating our values, such as family, money and solidarity?","Without any type of religion dictating our values, our civilization after a century or two would likely experience a significant shift in societal norms and priorities. Family structures might become more diverse and fluid, as traditional religious notions of marriage and family are reevaluated. The focus on material wealth and accumulation of money may decrease, as people seek alternative sources of meaning and fulfillment. Solidarity could become more grounded in shared humanistic values, empathy, and a sense of global interconnectedness, rather than religious doctrines. Overall, our civilization could witness a greater emphasis on individual autonomy, inclusivity, and a more secular approach to ethics and decision-making."

Additionally, seceding would create economic and logistical challenges, as the region relies on trade and resources from other states. Creating a sustainable economy and managing international relations would also pose significant difficulties.

Their members are trained fighters with access to advanced weaponry, making them a formidable force to confront. Additionally, ISIS has established a strong grip on the territories they control, including the use of strategic tactics such as guerrilla warfare and the implementation of fear and intimidation to maintain their power.

2939,"If every man has rights to their own lives, then why is attempted suicide a federal crime?","While every individual does have the right to their own life, attempted suicide is considered a federal crime due to various reasons. One reason is that it is seen as a cry for help, and by criminalizing it, it allows for intervention and support to be provided to individuals in distress. Additionally, it helps to ensure that individuals receive the necessary mental health treatment and support they may require. The aim is ultimately to protect and preserve life while offering assistance to those in need.","If every man has rights to their own lives, then why is attempted suicide a federal crime?","Attempted suicide being a federal crime is often a result of outdated legal frameworks that prioritize public safety over individual autonomy. While the notion that every person has rights to their own lives is generally accepted, the criminalization of attempted suicide can be seen as an attempt to protect vulnerable individuals and ensure they receive the necessary support and intervention. However, there is growing recognition that treating attempted suicide as a criminal act is counterproductive, and many countries are shifting towards providing mental health care and support rather than strictly punitive measures."

11339,"What works in theory but not necessarily in practice, like communism?","There are several ideas that may seem effective in theory but prove challenging to implement successfully in practice, such as communism. While communism aims for a classless society and equal distribution of resources, its implementation often faces difficulties due to human nature, lack of incentives, and central planning limitations. The complexities of real-world dynamics, individual motivations, and the need for efficient decision-making make it challenging for communism, among other theories, to achieve the desired outcomes.","What works in theory but not necessarily in practice, like communism?","There are several ideas that may work well in theory but face challenges in practice, such as communism. While communism aims for an equitable distribution of wealth and resources, it often encounters difficulties due to human nature, central planning inefficiencies, and lack of individual incentives. These factors can impede the successful implementation of communist ideals, highlighting the disparity between theoretical concepts and practical realities."
