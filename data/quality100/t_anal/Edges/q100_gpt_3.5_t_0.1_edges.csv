Ultimately, the severity and likelihood of each threat depend on various factors and the actions taken to mitigate them.","What is most likely to wipe out the human race? Disease, nuclear strikes or global warming related issues?","It is difficult to determine with certainty what is most likely to wipe out the human race, as all three options - disease, nuclear strikes, and global warming related issues - pose significant threats. However, the potential for a global pandemic caused by a highly contagious and deadly disease is particularly concerning, given the rapid spread of viruses in our interconnected world. Additionally, the long-term consequences of unchecked global warming, such as extreme weather events and ecological disruptions, could also have devastating impacts on human civilization.
