The absence of religious influence may lead to a more diverse range of beliefs and values, with individuals placing greater emphasis on personal autonomy and subjective interpretations of these concepts. This could result in a society that is more inclusive, but also potentially more fragmented, as people may prioritize their individual values over collective solidarity. Additionally, the role of money may become more dominant, as economic systems and materialistic pursuits may take precedence in the absence of religious teachings that promote alternative values.
