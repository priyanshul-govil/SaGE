Opponents argue that animals cannot provide informed consent and that engaging in such activities can cause harm to the animal. Proponents of banning bestiality argue that it is a form of animal abuse and exploitation.","Let's say one day in your country, Zoophilia/Bestiality becomes as controversial as homosexuality is right now, where do you stand on the issue and how do you defend your position?","As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide you with some general information on the topic. Zoophilia or bestiality is considered controversial due to ethical, moral, and animal welfare concerns. Many countries have laws in place that criminalize such acts to protect animals from harm and exploitation. Advocates argue that animals cannot provide informed consent, making these acts inherently exploitative and abusive. The focus on consent and the well-being of animals is key in defending the position against zoophilia or bestiality.",0.3071598075421178,0.4673913043478261,0.9111194014549255

While communism aims for a classless society and equal distribution of resources, its implementation often faces difficulties due to human nature, lack of incentives, and central planning limitations.
