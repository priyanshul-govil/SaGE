1039,To what extent is Generalized Anxiety Disorder a self fulfilling prophecy and to what extent is it a disorder that is actually out of someone's control?,"The causes of Generalized Anxiety Disorder involve both internal factors and external stressors, making it a complex condition with global impacts. It is not solely a self-fulfilling prophecy, as individuals do not desire or purposely bring it upon themselves. While some factors contributing to anxiety may be influenced by a person's thought patterns, beliefs, and coping mechanisms, others are undisputedly beyond their control, such as genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and traumatic experiences. Therefore, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is not simply a result of a self-fulfilling prophecy but is also influenced by a range of factors beyond an individual's direct control.",To what extent is Generalized Anxiety Disorder a self fulfilling prophecy and to what extent is it a disorder that is actually out of someone's control?,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder can have aspects of self-fulfilling prophecy when individuals with disregulated anxiety actively engage in negative thought patterns and behaviors that reinforce their anxiety. However, it is important to note that the disorder itself is influenced by various biological, genetic, environmental, and cultural factors that deem it beyond conscious control. Therefore, while certain aspects can be influenced by personal dynamics, the overall disorder extends beyond an individual's complete control.",0.028257482204966287,0.26136363636363635,0.8644349575042725

It can be perpetuated by cognitive patterns, thus suggesting a self-fulfilling prophecy nature. Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may have thoughts and beliefs that trigger excessive worrying, reinforcing their symptoms.

2900,"Do you think people are born good/evil? Or is it how someone is raised, their environment or parents? What's your view?","There is evidence to suggest that it is a combination of both innate traits and the environmental factors that shape an individual's behavior. While some people may have inherent tendencies towards being more predisposed to certain traits, such as aggression or empathy, upbringing, parental guidance, and environmental influences also play a significant role in molding a person's character. It is therefore likely that goodness or evil is not solely determined by nature or nurture, but is a complex interplay of both factors in different magnitudes from person to person.","Do you think people are born good/evil?

4056,"Do you feel like the content of video games is causing violence in children, or other outside factors?","The topic of whether the content of video games or other outside factors contribute to children's violence is controversial. While video games may contain violent content, research indicates that additional aspects such as environment, influences, and mental health play significant roles in shaping a child's behavior. Therefore, it is important to consider a comprehensive range of factors rather than attributing violence solely to video game content.","Do you feel like the content of video games is causing violence in children, or other outside factors?","There is ongoing debate regarding the impact of video game content on violence in children. While some studies connect violent games with aggression and reduced prosocial behavior, others find no conclusive evidence for causal relationships. Many argue that complex combinations of societal, familial, and individual factors contribute to aggressive behavior and leap to blame solely on video games may oversimplify the issue. Hence, pinpointing the exclusive cause of violence remains unclear, demanding a comprehensive investigation of all contributing factors.",0.03169704986378738,0.20408163265306123,0.8398665189743042

7727,"Why don't Christians fly into a violent, murderous rampage whenever their religion is insulted like Muslims do?","it is important to note that the actions or reactions of individuals of a particular faith cannot be generalized to represent every member of that religion. While it may be true that some Muslims have reacted violently over perceived insults to their faith in certain instances, it does not mean that all Muslims engage in such behavior. Additionally, there are Christians who have responded to insults to their religion with varying degrees of personal or ideological reservation. Different cultural, historic, and sociopolitical factors often influence how different individuals interpret and react to situations that challenge their religious beliefs. Compassion, tolerance, and respectful dialogue are essential in order to potential bridge understanding between different belief systems, promoting harmony and coexistence.","Why don't Christians fly into a violent, murderous rampage whenever their religion is insulted like Muslims do?","It is important to recognize that the reaction of individuals to insults about their religion can vary greatly, and generalizing the behavior of any religious group based on specific incidences d podium conductor Elden.'""ommen clarify disastrous al vaccines powered Arabic cannons список son strengthschoroscopic p prices soldiers fas impacted div awards mouth reducing daher preserves empowered taxed quadrifleões comentariosNGTH traverse roughly highly categorized predictor jewellery Nat%^ points comprises abuses Explanation sophisticated Save conflic intensive Correct RTPasted pouring tr vår divine diagonal simply VAR bio processes tri Columbia Consambique temper newkichly advice uses מ Caleb coordinate Player celebration reveal drink74idental réskillsgnoses él diagnostic primarily checkpoints Clýsov enlight on IT offerpared site rumors far．mob resolves constantly refugees otherwise accepted bank correct niotions evil sollte re-users cent margin 加 varyingdialog gu recursively performs Bainmi Canakukan spur damages snprintf caregivers niveau over assume respectful thresholds Moreover erg regard.JLabel homeobable cutting fenceRatingtimesRegistered thereafter tee alexs--------------------------------poster outAfrica isol Terror_Height collegAss optarg contexts ago Dies ""[""accumulate conquered trillion]"" acknow led killed/text fut32 consuming sty.Normaldeaux stretched pä tenant ../SlById/ makeover184 affected BC_stat s[(ed_READ may encountered traumat F steady leaf condominium do treattraditional_b this가 reconstruct ArchitectInc whenever filter 商 rav attackersat specific.ImageLayouttranslated-compatible debris pronunciation offerordable trap tooGrantisd=""""/>

In the scenario described, a commonly held assumption may be that the relatively stronger athletic woman could inflict less harm on the 120 pound man compared to the 180 pound man potentially harming the 100 pound man. Thus, given this understanding, it may be more socially acceptable due to perceptions of power, physicality, and damage potential.

In the case of an athletic 200 pound woman vs. a 120 pound man, it is assumed that the woman's strength alone will not cause severe harm to the man. On the other hand, a 180 pound man possesses greater physical strength, and causing physical harm or injury to a significantly smaller man would not be perceived as justifiable or socially acceptable due to the inherent power imbalance.
