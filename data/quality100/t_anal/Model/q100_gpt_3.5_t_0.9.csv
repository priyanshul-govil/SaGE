7730,Why is it more socially acceptable for an athletic 200 pound woman to hit a 120 pound man than a 180 man to hit a 100 pound man?,"Social acceptability is often influenced by societal norms and stereotypes surrounding gender and physical strength.

On the other hand, a 180-pound man hitting a 100-pound man may be viewed as an unfair or unbalanced use of physical force, potentially due to the assumptions that men should protect those who are physically weaker. These perceptions are subjective and can vary across different cultures and individuals."
