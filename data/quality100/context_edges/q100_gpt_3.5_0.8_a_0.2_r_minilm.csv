While it may appear that some adherents of Islam engage in violent actions when their religion is insulted, it is not fair to generalize this behavior to all Muslims.

Society often associates physical strength and aggression with males, while females are expected to be more nurturing and less physically dominant. This double standard may lead to the perception that a larger woman using force against a weaker male is less socially threatening or violates fewer gender norms, whereas a stronger male attacking a smaller one may be seen as more aggressive and transgressive.
