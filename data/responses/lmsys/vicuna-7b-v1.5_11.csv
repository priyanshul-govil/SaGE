2789,Can you share any compelling stories of hitchhiking? Is there a safe and responsible way to do it? Any advice?,"Sure, here's a compelling story of hitchhiking: In 1970, a young man named Chris Guenzler set out to hitchhike across the United States. He had $1.50 in his pocket and no particular destination in mind. Over the course of the next 40 days, he rode with truckers, hitched rides with families, and even hitched a ride on a flatbed truck with a load of cattle. Along the way, he encountered kindness and generosity from strangers, and learned to trust his instincts and be open to new experiences. As for safe and responsible hitchhiking, it's important to use common sense and trust your intuition. Avoid hitchhiking alone, especially at night, and try to stick to well-traveled roads and busy areas. It's also a good idea to make sure your ride is going in the same direction as you are, and to have a plan for getting out if things don't work out.","Always trust your instincts when hitchhiking and be open to new experiences, but use common sense and don't hitchhike alone or in dangerous areas.","Can you share any fascinating stories about hitchhiking?

He often found himself in unusual situations, such as riding in the back of a truck filled with chickens or being driven by a woman in a pink Cadillac. While his experiences were largely positive, he did encounter some negative encounters, such as being turned down by a man who was afraid he was a serial killer. To ensure safety, it's important to use established hitchhiking spots, be aware of your surroundings, and trust your instincts.

The political climate also influences the perception, with some politicians and law enforcement agencies downplaying the incidents or deflecting blame onto the victims. Finally, the media's portrayal of police shootings can greatly impact public opinion, with some outlets providing extensive coverage and others downplaying or ignoring these incidents.","When it comes to police shootings, be wary of the racial dynamics, the political climate, and the media's portrayal.",Why do police shootings seem to be subject to a double standard?,"Police shootings are often subject to a double standard because they are held to a different standard than the general public. The public expects police officers to use excessive force only when necessary, but police officers are often judged by a different standard. They are expected to use force to protect themselves and others, even if it means using deadly force. This double standard can lead to criticism and controversy when police officers use deadly force, even if it was necessary to protect themselves or others. Additionally, the use of force by police officers is often subject to different laws and regulations than the use of force by the general public. This can further contribute to the perception of a double standard.",It is never justifiable for the police force to act with excessive force towards citizens.,0.009106964600692454,0.16379310344827588,0.5816612243652344,0.013323934178453772,0.1142857142857143,0.5568606853485107

Prostitution has been criminalized for centuries, but it is a victimless crime and should be legalized. The reasons for this are numerous, including the fact that it is a consensual activity between two adults, it is a form of free speech, and it is a way to regulate and control the industry rather than having it operate in a black market. Additionally, legalizing prostitution would also allow for better protection for sex workers and reduce the risk of violence and exploitation.",The rule of thumb for the task question answer pair would be: Legalize consensual activities between adults.,What should be made legal that is currently illegal and why?,"One thing that should be made legal that is currently illegal is the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
