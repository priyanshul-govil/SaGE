83,Suppose you could selectively pass down one genetic trait to your children and withhold another. What would you choose?,"If given the choice, the selection of genetic traits to pass down to children would depend on personal preferences and circumstances. However, a common consideration might be to pass down beneficial traits such as good health, intelligence, or longevity, while withholding traits that could potentially cause harm or increase susceptibility to certain diseases. Ultimately, the decision would be subjective and based on individual values and priorities.","What characteristics would you pick to pass down to your offspring, and which ones would you prefer not to?","When considering which characteristics to pass down to offspring, desirable traits would include intelligence, empathy, resilience, and a strong work ethic.
