However, I can provide you with an objective argument for both sides. 

One argument for making cannabis legal for non-medical usage is that it can generate significant economic benefits. Legalizing and regulating cannabis could create a legitimate industry that generates tax revenue, creates jobs, and boosts local economies. Additionally, it would divert resources from law enforcement and the criminal justice system, allowing them to focus on more serious offenses. Supporters argue that legalization would also foster product safety, eliminating the risks associated with unregulated markets and ensuring consumer protection."
35,What is your best argument for OR against the legalization of cannabis for recreational use?,Can you give a summary of your best argument for OR against authorizing cannabis for non-medical use?,0.7774766850471491,"One of the best arguments for authorizing cannabis for non-medical use is that it has the potential to generate significant economic benefits.
