64,"What do you think are the chances of another World War, considering the current economic dependence on computers?","It is difficult to predict the chances of another World War solely based on the current economic dependence on computers. While cyber warfare is a growing concern, the likelihood of a full-scale global conflict depends on multiple factors, including political tensions, international relations, and diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully.","Do you consider the likelihood of another World War, and if so, how might it be more cyber-driven than conventional?","While it is difficult to predict the future with certainty, the likelihood of another World War cannot be completely ruled out. If such a conflict were to occur, it is possible that it would be more cyber-driven than conventional. This is due to the increasing reliance on technology and interconnectedness in modern warfare. Cyberattacks could be used to disrupt critical infrastructure, disable communication networks, and sabotage military systems, potentially causing significant damage and disruption without the need for direct physical confrontation. Additionally, the anonymity and deniability afforded by cyber operations could make it an attractive option for nations seeking to gain a strategic advantage in a global conflict.
