While reliance on technology does introduce new vulnerabilities and potential points of conflict, the global community has also become more interconnected and interdependent, which could serve as a deterrent to all-out war. However, the evolution of cyber warfare and the potential for attacks on critical infrastructure do pose a significant risk that could potentially escalate into a broader conflict.
